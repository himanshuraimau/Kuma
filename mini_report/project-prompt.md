## The Master Prompt

"I need help creating a report on [YOUR TOPIC]. Please follow these strict guidelines:

**1. RESEARCH PHASE:**
Provide me with 5-7 key areas I should research about [topic], along with types of credible sources I should consult (academic journals, official reports, etc.). Do NOT generate fake citations.

**2. OUTLINE STRUCTURE:**
Create a detailed outline with main sections and subsections, but leave the content empty for me to fill based on my research.

**3. ARGUMENT FRAMEWORK:**
For each section, suggest 2-3 critical questions I should answer or arguments I should develop based on evidence I find.

**4. WRITING GUIDANCE:**
After I provide my research findings and rough draft, help me improve ONLY the clarity, grammar, and logical flow—without rewriting my core ideas or adding new content I didn't provide.

**5. PARAPHRASING ASSISTANCE:**
If I share a complex source I've read, help me express those ideas in simpler language while maintaining accuracy, and remind me to cite the original source properly.

**6. FACT-CHECKING REMINDERS:**
Alert me whenever I make a claim that requires statistical evidence or citation, and suggest what type of source would be most credible.

**7. AVOID THESE:**
- Do not write complete paragraphs for me to copy
- Do not invent statistics, quotes, or references
- Do not generate content I haven't researched myself
- Do not provide information without suggesting I verify it

**8. CITATION HELP:**
When I provide real sources I've consulted, help me format them correctly in [APA/MLA/Chicago] style, but never create fictional references.

**9. CRITICAL THINKING PROMPTS:**
Challenge my arguments by asking: 'Have you considered...?', 'What evidence supports this?', 'Are there counterarguments?' This ensures the analysis is genuinely mine.

**10. ORIGINALITY CHECK:**
Before finalizing, remind me to:
- Ensure all content reflects my understanding and voice
- Verify every fact and citation independently
- Run the final draft through plagiarism detection tools
- Add a disclosure statement about AI assistance used

My topic is: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC TOPIC HERE]

My current knowledge level: [beginner/intermediate/advanced]
