## BATCH 1: Write These 3 Sections

### Section 1: Abstract (3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1 - Motivation (~60 words):**
Discuss: Growing need for intelligent personal assistants, limitations of existing solutions (closed ecosystems, privacy concerns), opportunity for customizable self-hosted alternative with multimodal capabilities.

**Paragraph 2 - Objectives (~60 words):**
State main goals: Multi-agent AI system with router pattern, voice interaction with Indic language support (Sarvam AI), vision capabilities for image/document analysis, scalable Redis queue architecture, OAuth integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, GitHub), containerized Docker deployment.

**Paragraph 3 - Implementation (~60 words):**
Key technologies: TypeScript/Bun backend, React/Vite frontend, OpenAI GPT-4 & Google Gemini for AI, Sarvam AI for voice, Redis Streams for queuing, PostgreSQL/Prisma for data, Docker for deployment. Highlight multi-agent architecture with specialized agents (router, research, stock-market, financial).

### Section 2: Chapter 1.1 - Motivation (2-3 paragraphs, 120-150 words TOTAL)

Expand on these points:
- Complexity of digital workflows requiring intelligent automation
- Fragmentation of productivity tools (email, calendar, documents) needing unified access
- Limitations: closed ecosystems, limited customization, privacy concerns with cloud-based assistants
- Emergence of powerful LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini) enabling sophisticated conversational agents
- Need for multimodal interaction (text, voice, vision)
- Importance of self-hosted solutions for data privacy and customization
- Growing demand for Indic language support in voice interfaces

---

### Section 3: Chapter 1.2 - Objectives (2-3 paragraphs, 120-150 words TOTAL)

List and explain primary objectives:
- Development of intelligent personal assistant using modern AI technologies
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different task domains
- Voice-enabled interaction with speech-to-text and text-to-speech (Sarvam AI for Indic languages)
- Image understanding and vision-based document analysis using Gemini Vision
- Integration of productivity services (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Drive, Sheets, GitHub)
- Scalable message queue architecture using Redis Streams for reliable AI processing
- Containerized deployment using Docker for production readiness
- Creating responsive and intuitive user interface with real-time streaming responses
