You are helping me rewrite a final-year undergraduate engineering project report.

Rewrite the following content so that:
• It sounds like it was written by a real final-year Computer Science engineering student
• Language is clear, technical, and correct but NOT overly polished
• Sentence lengths vary naturally (short + medium + long)
• The flow reflects human thinking, not textbook or survey style
• Avoid common academic stock phrases used in research papers
• Avoid definitions that sound copied from books or Wikipedia
• Reorder ideas logically instead of rewriting sentence-by-sentence
• Keep the meaning and technical accuracy exactly the same
• Add light human intent where appropriate (e.g., “in this project we focus on…”)
• Allow mild repetition of ideas if it feels natural
• Do NOT sound like marketing, a research survey, or an AI assistant
• Do NOT introduce new references or citations
• Do NOT add emojis, lists, or bullet points unless already present

Important constraints:
• The rewritten text must not resemble the original sentence structure
• The text must not resemble common phrasing from arXiv, IEEE, or student reports
• The output must reduce plagiarism and AI-detection likelihood

Rewrite only the content below. Do not add extra explanations.
